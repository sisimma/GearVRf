/**
 * Finds the scene objects that are hit by a ray.
 *
 * The picker can function in two modes. One way is to simply call its
 * static functions to make a single scan through the scene to determine
 * what is hit by the picking ray.
 * <p/>
 * The other way is to add the picker as a component to a scene object.
 * The picking ray is generated from the camera viewpoint
 * each frame. It's origin is the camera position and it's direction is
 * the camera forward look vector (what the user is looking at).
 * <p/>
 * For a {@linkplain GVRSceneObject scene object} to be pickable, it must have a
 * {@link GVRCollider} component attached to it that is enabled.
 * The picker "casts" a ray into the screen graph, and returns an array
 * containing all the collisions as instances of GVRPickedObject.
 * The picked object contains the collider instance hit, the distance from the
 * camera and the hit position.
 * <p/>
 * The picker maintains the list of currently picked objects
 * (which can be obtained with getPicked()) and continually updates it each frame.
 * <p/>
 * In this mode, when the ray from the scene object hits a pickable object,
 * the picker generates one or more pick events (IPickEvents interface)
 * which are sent the event receiver of the scene. These events can be
 * observed by listeners.
 * <ul>>
 * <li>onEnter(GVRSceneObject)  called when the pick ray enters a scene object.</li>
 * <li>onExit(GVRSceneObject)   called when the pick ray exits a scene object.</li>
 * <li>onInside(GVRSceneObject) called while the pick ray penetrates a scene object.</li>
 * <li>onPick(GVRPicker)        called when the set of picked objects changes.</li>
 * <li>onNoPick(GVRPicker)      called once when nothing is picked.</li>
