/**
 * Finds the scene objects that intersect the scene object the
 * picker is attached to.
 *
 * For a {@linkplain GVRSceneObject scene object} to be pickable, it must have a
 * {@link GVRCollider} component attached to it that is enabled.
 * The picker returns an array containing all the collisions as instances of GVRPickedObject.
 * The picked object contains the collider instance, the distance between
 * the colliding and the scene object and the center of the scene object hit
 * in world coordinates.
 *
 * The picker maintains the list of currently
 * picked objects which can be obtained with getPicked() and continually
 * updates it each frame. When a pickable object is inside the view frustum,
 * the picker generates one or more pick events (IPickEvents interface)
 * which are sent the event receiver of the scene. These events can be
 * observed by listeners.
 *  - onEnter(GVRSceneObject)  called when the scene object enters the frustum.
 *  - onExit(GVRSceneObject)   called when the scene object exits the frustum.
 *  - onInside(GVRSceneObject) called while the scene object is inside the frustum.
 *  - onPick(GVRPicker)        called when the set of picked objects changes.
 *  - onNoPick(GVRPicker)      called once when nothing is picked.
